# Classifier_X

Classifier_X is a Python project that aims to automate the process of comparing multiple machine learning classifiers and evaluating their performance metrics on a given dataset.

## Features

- Supports a wide range of machine learning classifiers including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and many more.
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices for each classifier.
- Enables easy comparison of classifiers based on their performance metrics through visualizations.
- Supports preprocessing steps such as data scaling and encoding of categorical variables.
